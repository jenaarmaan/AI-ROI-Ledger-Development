# AI ROI Ledger

**Day 2 / 50 – AI Systems Engineering Challenge**

AI systems often become cost centers because their impact is not measured against
business outcomes. This project demonstrates a simple but powerful idea:

> **Treat AI usage like financial transactions and compute ROI per use case.**

---

## 🔍 What This Prototype Shows

- AI usage events logged with cost metadata
- KPI hypotheses attached to each AI use case
- Manual outcome evidence (for early-stage measurement)
- ROI classification:
  - POSITIVE
  - NEGATIVE
  - UNKNOWN
- Weekly-style ROI summary to identify:
  - High-value AI workflows
  - Loss-making AI usage
  - Areas needing more data

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Measure before optimizing**
- **Manual inputs are acceptable in early systems**
- **ROI visibility > AI sophistication**
- **Built for clarity, not scale (yet)**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

- Outcomes are manually entered
- ROI values are simplified estimates
- No authentication or role-based access
- Not production-ready (by design)
